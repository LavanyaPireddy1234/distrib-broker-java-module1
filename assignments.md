# Participant Assignments: Kafka Group Membership Fundamentals

## **Course Overview**

This course focuses on the **fundamental concepts** of Kafka group membership using ZooKeeper for distributed coordination. Participants will learn core distributed systems patterns through hands-on implementation of broker discovery, registration, and change notification systems.

## **Assignment 1: Disk Performance Analysis** ✅ *Already Implemented*

### **Objective**
Understand storage I/O impact on distributed systems and why durability guarantees affect performance.

### **Background**
Distributed systems like Kafka must balance performance with durability. Understanding disk I/O characteristics is crucial for designing high-performance distributed systems that can guarantee data persistence.

### **Tasks**
1. **Run Performance Tests**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew run --args="com.dist.perf.DiskWritePerformanceTest"
   ```

2. **Analyze Different Scenarios**:
   - Run tests with and without `fsync()` calls
   - Compare buffered vs unbuffered writes
   - Measure throughput degradation with durability guarantees

3. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Calculate writes per second and MB/s throughput
   - Analyze the relationship between durability and performance
   - Document the trade-offs between speed and data safety

### **Learning Outcomes**
- Understand I/O bottlenecks in distributed systems
- Learn trade-offs between performance and durability
- Analyze system performance characteristics under load
- Apply performance measurement techniques

## **Assignment 2: Queuing Theory Analysis** ✅ *Already Implemented*

### **Objective**
Apply queuing theory and mathematical models to understand system performance characteristics and predict behavior under load.

### **Background**
Distributed systems behavior can be modeled using queuing theory. Understanding Little's Law, M/M/1 queues, and the Universal Scalability Law helps predict system performance and identify bottlenecks.

### **Tasks**
1. **Queuing Theory Analysis**:
   ```bash
   cd src/main/python
   python queuing_theory.py
   ```

2. **Performance Visualization**:
   ```bash
   python queuing_theory_visualization.py
   ```

3. **Universal Scalability Law**:
   ```bash
   python universal_scalability_law.py
   ```
   
4. **Custom Analysis**:
   - Modify service rates and analyze different scenarios
   - Compare ideal vs realistic system behavior
   - Identify system saturation points

5. **Real-World Application**:
   - Apply these models to Kafka broker scenarios
   - Predict performance under different load patterns
   - Design capacity planning recommendations


### **Learning Outcomes**
- Understand Little's Law and queue behavior
- Learn to predict system performance under varying loads
- Analyze scalability limits using mathematical models
- Apply theoretical concepts to practical system design

## **Assignment 3: Implement Broker Registration** ✅ *Partially Implemented*

### **Objective**
Complete and enhance the ZooKeeper-based broker registration system with robust error handling, retry logic, and comprehensive monitoring.

### **Background**
Service registration is a fundamental pattern in distributed systems. Brokers must register themselves in ZooKeeper using ephemeral nodes that automatically clean up when the broker fails.

### **Current Implementation Status**
Nede to complete the following tasks:
 - Complete the existing `registerBroker()` method by creating an ephemeral node.


#### **3.1 Optional - Enhanced Error Handling**
Improve the existing `registerBroker()` method:

```java
public void registerBroker(Broker broker) {
    int maxRetries = 3;
    int retryDelayMs = 1000;
    
    for (int attempt = 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++) {
        try {
            String brokerValue = JsonSerDes.toJson(broker);
            String brokerKey = getBrokerPath(broker.id());
            
            // TODO: Handle ZkNodeExistsException appropriately
            // TODO: Add exponential backoff for retries
            // TODO: Log detailed error information
            
            createEphemeralPath(zkClient, brokerKey, brokerValue);
            
            // TODO: Update local cache atomically
            // TODO: Notify registered listeners
            // TODO: Log successful registration
            
            return; // Success
            
        } catch (ZkNodeExistsException e) {
            // TODO: Handle broker ID conflicts
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // TODO: Implement retry logic with backoff
            if (attempt == maxRetries - 1) {
                throw new RuntimeException("Broker registration failed after " + maxRetries + " attempts", e);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
### **Learning Outcomes**
- Understand ephemeral nodes and ZooKeeper session management
- Learn distributed system failure patterns and recovery strategies
- Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- Design monitoring and observability for distributed services

## **Assignment 4: Advanced Broker Change Notifications** ✅ *Partially Implemented*

### **Objective**
Implement an event-driven system for detecting and handling broker membership changes with efficient change detection and proper cleanup.

### **Background**
In distributed systems, components must react to membership changes efficiently. This requires implementing the "list-and-watch" pattern to avoid race conditions and ensure eventual consistency.

### **Tasks**

#### **4.1 Enhanced Change Listener**
Implement a sophisticated broker change listener:

```java
public class BrokerChangeListener implements IZkChildListener {
    private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(BrokerChangeListener.class);
    
    private final Map<String, Broker> activeBrokers = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    private final List<BrokerMembershipObserver> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private final ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
    
    @Override
    public void handleChildChange(String parentPath, List<String> currentChildren) {
        lock.writeLock().lock();
        try {
            Set<String> currentBrokerIds = new HashSet<>(currentChildren != null ? currentChildren : Collections.emptyList());
            Set<String> previousBrokerIds = new HashSet<>(activeBrokers.keySet());
            
            // TODO: Detect broker additions
            Set<String> addedBrokers = new HashSet<>(currentBrokerIds);
            addedBrokers.removeAll(previousBrokerIds);
            
            // TODO: Detect broker removals
            Set<String> removedBrokers = new HashSet<>(previousBrokerIds);
            removedBrokers.removeAll(currentBrokerIds);
            
            // TODO: Handle additions
            for (String brokerId : addedBrokers) {
                handleBrokerAdded(brokerId);
            }
            
            // TODO: Handle removals
            for (String brokerId : removedBrokers) {
                handleBrokerRemoved(brokerId);
            }
            
        } finally {
            lock.writeLock().unlock();
        }
    }
    
    private void handleBrokerAdded(String brokerId) {
        // TODO: Fetch broker information
        // TODO: Update local cache
        // TODO: Notify observers
        // TODO: Log the addition
    }
    
    private void handleBrokerRemoved(String brokerId) {
        // TODO: Remove from local cache
        // TODO: Notify observers
        // TODO: Clean up any resources
        // TODO: Log the removal
    }
}
```

#### **4.2 Observer Pattern Implementation**
Create an observer system for broker changes:

```java
public interface BrokerMembershipObserver {
    void onBrokerAdded(Broker broker);
    void onBrokerRemoved(Broker broker);
    void onMembershipChanged(Set<Broker> currentBrokers);
}

public class BrokerMembershipManager {
    // TODO: Implement observer registration and notification
    // TODO: Handle observer failures gracefully
    // TODO: Provide current membership snapshot
}
```

#### **4.3 Race Condition Prevention**
Implement the "list-and-watch" pattern:
- Get initial broker list before setting up watches
- Handle the race condition between listing and watching
- Ensure consistency between local cache and ZooKeeper state

#### **4.4 Comprehensive Testing**
Create extensive tests:
- Test broker addition/removal scenarios
- Test rapid membership changes
- Test network partitions and reconnections
- Test observer notification reliability

### **Learning Outcomes**
- Learn to handle dynamic membership changes efficiently
- Implement observer patterns in distributed systems
- Handle race conditions and consistency issues
- Design resilient distributed system components
